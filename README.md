# About
This modal terminal text editor was created to help me become familiar with the C language and become comfortable with data structures, understand low-level concepts, and general programming in a mid-level language.
My goal is that after I finish going through the tutorial, I can extend some features (undo, redo, and LSP errors for starters). 
I will write my own code without referencing the tutorial where I can and when I'm stuck, I'll go through the tutorial for that portion.

- For the low-level stuff (terminal control, disabling terminal flags etc.) I leaned heavily on this instruction booklet: https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/
